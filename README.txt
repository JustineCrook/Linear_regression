* UTILITIES:
- Contains the python code used. 
- general.py: The code to generate data.
- single_reg_no_uplims.py: ROXY method for linear regression when there are no upper limits.
- single_reg.py: ROXY method for linear regression, expanded to include upper limits.
- multiple_reg.py: ROXY method for multiple linear regression, expanded to include upper limits.

* NOTEBOOKS:
- Contains the notebooks used to display the results.
- 0_generating_mock_data.ipynb: Shows examples of the generated mock data. 
- 1_1_roxy_method_no_uplims.ipynb & 1_2_roxy_package_comparison.ipynb: Shows the results of the ROXY single linear regression method with just detections, and compares the results to the ROXY package. 
- 2_1_roxy_method_with_uplims.ipynb & 2_2_roxy_method_with_uplims_marg.ipynb: Shows the results of the ROXY method for single linear regression, expanded to include upper limits. The latter shows the results when x is marginalised over. 
- 3_1_multiple_reg_no_uplims.ipynb & 3_2_roxy_package_comparison.ipynb: Shows the results of the ROXY multiple linear regression method with just detections, and compares the results to the ROXY package. 
- 4_multiple_reg_with_uplims.ipynb: Shows the results of the ROXY method for multiple linear regression, expanded to include upper limits. 

* DATA:
- Contains the LrLx data used to generate the mock data.
